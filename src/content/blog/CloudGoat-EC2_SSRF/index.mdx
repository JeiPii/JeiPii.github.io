# EC2_SSRF

Difficulty: Medium

Description: Starting as the IAM user Solus, the attacker discovers they have ReadOnly permissions to a Lambda function, where hardcoded secrets lead them to an EC2 instance running a web application that is vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF). After exploiting the vulnerable app and acquiring keys from the EC2 metadata service, the attacker gains access to a private S3 bucket with a set of keys that allow them to invoke the Lambda function and complete the scenario.

Lab activation command: `cloudgoat create ec2_ssrf`

# The Walkthrough

So it took me about 3 days to complete this machine because I had to step away from the machine on the occasion. This resulted in me having many different access keys and secret keys so to keep things simpele I will just say my Access Key or my Secret key I will show some for example purposes. This is also a CTF that was part of the [Intro to AWS Pentesting course by Tyler Ramsbey on SimplyCyber](https://academy.simplycyber.io/p/introduction-to-aws-pentesting)

Before starting these labs, make sure you have your budget setup on AWS. so that you won't get a surprise bill from Amazon.

We start by activating the lab: `cloudgoat create ec2_ssrf`

From here you get an access en secret key which we instantly setup with the `aws configure --profile` command. 
## Initial credentials
```
[cloudgoat] terraform output completed with no error code.
cloudgoat_output_solus_access_key_id = AKIAR<REDACTED>
cloudgoat_output_solus_secret_key = ZtN8P<REDACTED>

┌──(jp㉿SamsungS22)-[~]
└─$ aws configure --profile ec2_ssrfuser
AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIAR<REDACTED>
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: ZtN8P<REDACTED>
Default region name [None]: us-east-1
Default output format [None]: json
```

## Assumed breach
So because we are given keys, and because we have access to the console I am leaning that this is an assumed breach scenario. With this in mind there are a couple ways that this machine can be enumerated. For the completeness I will show some AWS WebGUI elements, AWS-CLI enumeration and the Metasploit of AWS Pacu enumeration.


# Web GUI

![](./Cloudgoat_EC2_SSRF_Taking_over_AWS_through_EC2_and_SSRF._i165pp.png)

When you get on the console you will be greeted with a screen similar to mine above. From here we will first search for Lambda

![](./Cloudgoat_EC2_SSRF_Taking_over_AWS_through_EC2_and_SSRF._g7ucb3.png)

If you don't see a button like 
![](./Cloudgoat_EC2_SSRF_Taking_over_AWS_through_EC2_and_SSRF._w6t5yf.png)this make sure you are in the correct zone.
I deployed my cloudgoat in us-east-1 so I can only see these functions there.
![](./Cloudgoat_EC2_SSRF_Taking_over_AWS_through_EC2_and_SSRF._uu6sn1.png)

This is one of the biggest downsides of the console if you aren't in the correct zone no dice. Which when you are starting out might be an easy win when pentesting. 

Clicking on "manage functions" brings us to the function dashboard.
![](./Cloudgoat_EC2_SSRF_Taking_over_AWS_through_EC2_and_SSRF._0rrakr.png)

from here move to "Configuration" and check out the Environment Function often a place where you can find juicy information.
![](./Cloudgoat_EC2_SSRF_Taking_over_AWS_through_EC2_and_SSRF._pbnqhb.png)

We find a new pair of Access and Secret keys. This might come over as unprofessional or unrealistic. But this happens more often than not. In AWS the engineers often neglect security.
![](./Cloudgoat_EC2_SSRF_Taking_over_AWS_through_EC2_and_SSRF._4cz8db.png)

If this was a real environment there would've maybe be more to find. But for now thats the console part. We will come back to the console later on.

## CLI
As I learned with OSCP let's first learn to do things by hand and get a good foundation before we move on to shiny and fancy one-stop solutions like Pacu. 

From here we are starting over again from the access and secret we got from cloudgoat itself. 

Let's start by authenticating:
```
aws configure --profile ec2_ssrfuser
AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIAR<REDACTED>
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: ZtN8P<REDACTED>
Default region name [None]: us-east-1
Default output format [None]: json
```
With `aws stst get-caller-identity --profile` we get to know who we are logged in as. With these credentials we apparently are Solus.
![](./Cloudgoat_EC2_SSRF_Taking_over_AWS_through_EC2_and_SSRF_wz1pbl.png)

Because of the description of the CTF we know that we have ReadOnly to the lambda functions. Normally we should've enumerated for this or we just attempt to list and get lucky that it returns information.
So lets see what we can list and what we can find.

}    
```
In about the middle of the code block we see those credentials that we found in the Web GUI. So lets check how we can do this with Pacu.

> Small tip, the problem with the region could've happened here as well. Where if we picked the wrong region or a engineer for some reason used a completely wrong region we wouldn't have seen any outcome.
> It it possible to make a bash script that will through all the regions just to be sure. This is automatically done in Pacu, but lets remind ourselves of Murphy' Law and have backup tools and options.
## Pacu Walkthrough
start up Pacu and you hacked AWS already...

Make sure to make a new profile 
![](./Cloudgoat_EC2_SSRF_Taking_over_AWS_through_EC2_and_SSRF_f1ct6b.png)
 
 `import_keys` if you have them saved on your machine. 
```
Pacu (solus:No Keys Set) > import_keys ec2_ssrfuser
  Imported keys as "imported-ec2_ssrfuser"
Pacu (solus:imported-ec2_ssrfuser) > whoami
{
  "UserName": null,
  "RoleName": null,
  "Arn": null,
  "AccountId": null,
  "UserId": null,
  "Roles": null,
  "Groups": null,
  "Policies": null,
  "AccessKeyId": "AKIAR<REDACTED>",
  "SecretAccessKey": "ZtN8P<REDACTED>",
  "SessionToken": null,
  "KeyAlias": "imported-ec2_ssrfuser",
  "PermissionsConfirmed": null,
  "Permissions": {
    "Allow": {},
    "Deny": {}
  }
}
```
Do a quick search for what Pacu can do with Lambda.
```
Pacu (solus:imported-ec2_ssrfuser) > search lambda

[Category: PERSIST]

    Creates a Lambda function and CloudWatch Events rule to backdoor new EC2 security groups.

    Creates a Lambda function and CloudWatch Events rule to backdoor new IAM roles.

    Creates a Lambda function and CloudWatch Events rule to backdoor new IAM users.

  lambda__backdoor_new_roles
  lambda__backdoor_new_sec_groups
  lambda__backdoor_new_users

[Category: ENUM]

    Enumerates data from AWS Lambda.

  lambda__enum
```
Starting at the beginning make it perform some enumeration of the Lambda function.
```
Pacu (solus:imported-ec2_ssrfuser) > run lambda__enum --region us-east-1
  Running module lambda__enum...
[lambda__enum] Starting region us-east-1...
[lambda__enum]   Enumerating data for cg-lambda-cgid2zorxzunfb
        [+] Secret (ENV): EC2_ACCESS_KEY_ID= AKIAR<REDACTED>
        [+] Secret (ENV): EC2_SECRET_KEY_ID= Wm7OR<REDACTED>
[lambda__enum] lambda__enum completed.

[lambda__enum] MODULE SUMMARY:

  1 functions found in us-east-1. View more information in the DB 
```
Pacu is very convenient and has a secrets scanner build in. So the access and secret key are highlighted in the terminal.

From here we see that all the steps we did before have been condensed to basicaly one command in Pacu.

# Moving on to EC2

## Console Walkthrough:

On https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com
Search for EC2 in the top search bar and *make sure you are in the right region* go to the dashboard on the sidebar and click instances (running). Here we are greeted by our instance.

> Some note worthy things are that developers often give good and clear names to their EC2 giving a pentester a good understanding of what the machine might be used.

> A real world tip, save all public IP's and run an NMAP scan against them you might find interesting things.

Let's first go through "user data" a place that automates the configuration of your instance at launch time. See if we can find a hint. Quick side note, in the screenshot we also see the Public IPv4 address this is important for later.
![](./Cloudgoat_EC2_SSRF_Taking_over_AWS_through_EC2_and_SSRF_oybocx.png)

This reveals a bash script which gives us an indication of what this machine is used on and potentially if we could score ourselves some juicy credentials.
```
#!/bin/bash
apt-get update
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get -y install nodejs unzip
cd /home/ubuntu
unzip app.zip -d ./app
cd app
npm install
sudo node app.js &
echo -e "\n* * * * * root node /home/ubuntu/app/app.js &\n* * * * * root sleep 10; node /home/ubuntu/app/app.js &\n* * * * * root sleep 20; node /home/ubuntu/app/app.js &\n* * * * * root sleep 30; node /home/ubuntu/app/app.js &\n* * * * * root sleep 40; node /home/ubuntu/app/app.js &\n* * * * * root sleep 50; node /home/ubuntu/app/app.js &\n" >> /etc/crontab
```

In the top clicking back onto the instances(i-0d1d447393d7b0d1) shows a dashboard about this instance.
![](./Cloudgoat_EC2_SSRF_Taking_over_AWS_through_EC2_and_SSRF_wb13hx.png)
From here we click into the IAM role to see if this has any abusable permissions.
![](./Cloudgoat_EC2_SSRF_Taking_over_AWS_through_EC2_and_SSRF_67yqmu.png)
Clicking through will show us some beautiful permissions.
![](./Cloudgoat_EC2_SSRF_Taking_over_AWS_through_EC2_and_SSRF_i2ypwh.png)
Full Access to Cloudwatch and S3 `<3` 
![](./Cloudgoat_EC2_SSRF_Taking_over_AWS_through_EC2_and_SSRF_oc3vnl.png)

So at the time for writing I am not sure yet what I could do with CloudWatch but thats not relevant atm. I will either learn about it from the Tyler Ramsbey course or from the HackTricks AWS or of course ad-hoc style when I need to look more into it. 
Moving on with the S3 rights when we manage full access to the EC2 we will be able to abuse the the S3 and CloudWatch policies.

# CLI and Pacu Walkthrough
## Initial Credentials
These credentials are straight from the Solus user when we enumerate the Lambda function. 
```
[lambda__enum]   Enumerating data for cg-lambda-cgid2zorxzunfb
        [+] Secret (ENV): EC2_ACCESS_KEY_ID= AKIAR<REDACTED>
        [+] Secret (ENV): EC2_SECRET_KEY_ID= Wm7OR<REDACTED>
```

lets check who we are:
```

So this is very overwhelming and you have to search to it quite well and for sure know what you are looking for.
It will be even more overwhelming when you have 50 instances giving you all their output spread over multiple regions. 

There is some key info that we will always want to know about an EC2 instance:
- What instance profile is set to it.
- What IAM profile is set to the instance
we have a tailer made query for this.

What instance profile is set to it:
```
aws ec2 describe-instances --query "Reservations[*].Instances[*].IamInstanceProfile.Arn" --region us-east-1 --profile EC2
```

What IAM profile is set to the instance:
```
┌──(jp㉿SamsungS22)-[~/cloudgoat/ec2_ssrf]
└─$ aws ec2 describe-instances --query "Reservations[*].Instances[*].IamInstanceProfile.Arn" --region us-east-1 --profile EC2

        "arn:aws:iam::091303277569:instance-profile/cg-ec2-instance-profile-cgido2rmib5anj"

```

And a commando to list the security Group (Ports like **22** for SSH and **80** for HTTP should stand out.)

Armed with this info we know that something is running on port 80 and 22 using the public IP address leads us to a website which we will get back to right after the back walkthrough.

## Enumerate EC2s Automatically with Pacu

-   Launch Pacu:
```
pacu
```

-   Start a new session:
```
0
```

Name the session something like `ec2`.
-   Import your AWS profile keys:
```
import_keys EC2
```

-   Search for EC2 enumeration modules:
```
search ec2
```

-   Run the enumeration module:
```
run ec2__enum
```

-   View results:
```
data ec2
```

This will pull instances, elastic IPs, security groups, and more  across **all regions** by default!

From here lets move to finishing this lab environment.

# Finding and Identifying the SSRF.

From here we use the previous found public IP where we saw that port 80 and 22 are open on the public IP.

Here we are greeted by a website:
![](./Cloudgoat_EC2_SSRF_Taking_over_AWS_through_EC2_and_SSRF_aao8ug.png)

Using knowledge obtained from CPTS, OSCP and Burp Suite academy, when seeing SSRF there probably is some kind of GET variable that we will be able to abuse.

Whilst looking around in writeups I also saw a tool called [Arjun](https://github.com/s0md3v/Arjun) which would be able to find the same Variable.

With this parameter we can query the instance metadata service which will always be hosted at: `169.254.169.254` 
![](./Cloudgoat_EC2_SSRF_Taking_over_AWS_through_EC2_and_SSRF_w5vn4f.png)

Which we can than traverse and find juicy information.
![](./Cloudgoat_EC2_SSRF_Taking_over_AWS_through_EC2_and_SSRF_rqooje.png)

Skipping right to the money I query till: http://54.85.53.2/?url=169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/cg-ec2-role-cgido2rmib5anj

This gave me some new creds:

>When doing a pentest and you get a machine from the customer that use aws you should always check /home/$USER/.aws/credentials. Maybe you can find some old stored credentials and take over aws that way.

So make a profile for these new creds and see who we are:
![](./Cloudgoat_EC2_SSRF_Taking_over_AWS_through_EC2_and_SSRF_rgq4yt.png)
So... we need to put in some kind of Token...
I tried doing this manually but something was breaking it.
So I found this way, which worked like a charm.
```

As we knew from our earlier enumeration this might be the credentials that has full S3 access.

![](./Cloudgoat_EC2_SSRF_Taking_over_AWS_through_EC2_and_SSRF_a5orx6.png)

Another set of creds, let's setup an other profile and see if we got any lambda functions.
![](./Cloudgoat_EC2_SSRF_Taking_over_AWS_through_EC2_and_SSRF_elb0eh.png)
Which we do and let's run this function:
![](./Cloudgoat_EC2_SSRF_Taking_over_AWS_through_EC2_and_SSRF_x53tui.png)

That's the whole writeup of CloudGoats AWS scenario EC2_SSRF.

Don't forget to:
```
cloudgoat destroy ec2_ssrf
```
Unless you want to fund Jeff Bezos's next wedding.

Push to prod, test in your cloud. Catch you in the next jp.log.

Have a good one,

JP.
